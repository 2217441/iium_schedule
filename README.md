## Developers Manual

Please refer [wiki](https://github.com/iqfareez/iium_schedule/wiki).

## Motivation

To make a tool that can generate a beautiful, lockscreen-worthy schedule for IIUM students.

Usually, students will use ClassUp app to make a schedule, but they have to enter the information manually. IIUM Schedule app only needs minimal information, as it will fetch from IIUM databases to fill the rest of the required information.
