# IIUM Schedule App

Generate a beautiful & clean IIUM Schedule quickly with automatic subject data fetching. View what courses are available to register at your fingertips.

Just provide the app with your kuliyyah, course codes and section. It'll handle the rest :wink:.

## Motivation

To make a tool that can generate a beautiful, lockscreen-worthy schedule for IIUM students.

Usually, students will use [ClassUp](https://classup.plokia.com/) app to make a schedule, but they have to enter the information manually. IIUM Schedule app only needs minimal information, as it will fetch from IIUM databases to fill the rest of the required information.
